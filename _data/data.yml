    summary: |
      My name is Simon and I'm a passionate developer. I love learning and trying new things.
      I did my apprenticeship at Provinzial Rheinland Versicherung AG in cooporation with codecentric AG, Solingen. 
      Besides the thorough training in Java and Cobol, a strong focus was placed on data structures, algorithmics and software architecture.
      Instead of the traditional 3 years, this apprenticeship was shortened to 2.5 years.

      Besides my job, I like tinkering and learning with my homelab, coding small, private projects and solve capture the flags on hackthebox.com.
